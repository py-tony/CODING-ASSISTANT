# CODING-ASSISTANT
As beginner sometime you just need  to get more details about the program or task you're working on in order to write it, and you end up spending more time googling instead of learning I've noticed that students who search for learning content can be overwhelmed and discouraged by too many search results that do not meet their needs. Students need to use their time learning, not searching for learning content. I believe that Hyperiondev has great content and therefore students here must become self-service. this can decrease the need for Human resource and allow mentors to focus on students who really need that direct human attention.
