# This is an example program.
# The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the different operations of different variables.


num_one = 10
num_squared = num_one * num_one 


# You can use a variable to create new variables as seen above.


print(num_squared)


first_name = "Tim"
second_name = "Adams"
full_name = first_name + second_name 


# But don't forget a space between the two names, otherwise full_name just stores "TimAdams".
# Adding a space in-between the names:


full_name = first_name + " " + second_name 


print(full_name)


NUM = 10
